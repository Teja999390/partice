To change the name of a branch in Git, you can use the following command. Make sure you are on the branch you want to rename or specify the branch name directly.

If you are currently on the branch you want to rename, use:

bash

Run
Copy code
git branch -m new-branch-name
If you are not on the branch you want to rename, use:

bash

Run
Copy code
git branch -m old-branch-name new-branch-name
Replace old-branch-name with the current name of the branch and new-branch-name with the desired new name.
