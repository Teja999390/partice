Session Manager usage:
Connect to your instance without SSH keys, a bastion host, or opening any inbound ports.
Sessions are secured using an AWS Key Management Service key.
You can log session commands and details in an Amazon S3 bucket or CloudWatch Logs log group.
Configure sessions on the Session Manager Preferences  page.
